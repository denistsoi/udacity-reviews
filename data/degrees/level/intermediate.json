Despite Artificial Intelligence becoming increasingly accessible and ubiquitous, 94% of enterprises are struggling to implement AI in their organizations. The AI for Business Leaders Executive Program will empower you to strategically implement AI in your organization so you can leverage such revolutionary technologies for corporate growth. You\u2019ll develop foundational technical knowledge of machine learning and the business applications of artificial intelligence across industries. Through practical case studies, you\u2019ll learn what strategic questions to ask, and how to formulate proposals when evaluating opportunities to embed machine learning processes and artificial intelligence technology into a corporate strategy. Finally, in the capstone project, you will build an AI-backed strategy that can be integrated into your own business!",

    "syllabus": "<p>In the Nanodegree program, you\u2019ll build five portfolio-worthy apps. Depending on your knowledge and skill level, you can either learn the necessary skills through our supporting courses, or jump into building the apps directly. A summary of each of these apps, as well as a link to their supporting course are included in the sections below.</p><h3>Pitch Perfect</h3><p>Ever wondered what you\u2019d sound like as a Chipmunk or Darth Vader? Wonder no more! In this first project, you\u2019ll build an app that records a user\u2019s voice and then plays the modulated audio through a variety of filters.</p><h3>MemeMe</h3><p>Solidify your knowledge of iOS user interface concepts by building an app that creates memes from images! The project is split into two parts. In part 1, you\u2019ll create an app that enables the user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share the meme with friends. In part 2, you\u2019ll display sent memes in both a table and collection view.</p><h3>On the Map</h3><p>By incorporating networking, apps truly become \"mobile\" -- interacting with interesting data using popular web services. In this project, you\u2019ll build your first networked app that displays information posted by other Udacity students. You\u2019ll create a map view with pins representing student locations, and by tapping a pin, the app will display a custom URL posted by a student.</p><h3>Virtual Tourist</h3><p>Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch! In this project, you\u2019ll build an app that lets you tour the world from the comfort of your own couch. Users will be able to drop pins on a map, download pictures for the location, and save favorites to their device.</p><h3>You Decide!</h3><p>Landing a job as an iOS Developer requires more than technical skills; it requires creativity and innovation. Drawing on everything you\u2019ve learned so far in the Nanodegree, you&#39;ll now dream up, design, and code your own custom app.</p>",

    "faq": "**Q. Can students expect to get VR-related jobs as a result?**Udacity\u2019s Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree gives students the needed VR skills to get hired by a company with a VR team. It\u2019s also intended for students interested in starting their own VR software companies (i.e. conceive VR apps, design, build and publish apps).**Q. Will Udacity\u2019s job guarantee apply to this Nanodegree?**Udacity\u2019s Nanodegree Plus (i.e. job guarantee) program is not yet applicable to the Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree. However, this may change as we further build out the curriculum. **Q. What\u2019s the average time to complete the Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree?**On average, students should complete the Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree in 6-8 months. The curriculum includes 6 projects and 7 courses.**Q. What are the prerequisite skills to take the Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree?**Students must have advanced computer science skills to take the Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree. Beginners may start by taking our <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000\">Intro to Programming Nanodegree </a>  or our free courses in <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-languages--cs262\">Programming Languages</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/software-debugging--cs259\">Software Debugging</a>. Students can also take our free course in <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/computational-photography--ud955\">Computational Photography</a> to understand 3D scenes and the image formation process which are fundamental concepts behind VR video and photography or our free <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810\">Introduction to Computer Vision</a> course to learn the foundations behind Virtual Reality tracking and camera-based user interaction.**Q. What hardware is needed to take the Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree?**Students require a smartphone: Android (S4 or up) or iPhone (iPhone 5 or up) and access to a computer (Windows or Mac) to develop the projects. For the optional Specialization Track on \"High Immersion VR\", students must have VR-ready PC + HTC Vive or Oculus Rift VR headset (also see prerequisites for the Nanodegree program).",
