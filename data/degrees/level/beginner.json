    "syllabus": "<h2>What You Will Build</h2><p>As you progress through this Nanodegree you will document what you&#39;re learning in a web page that you&#39;ll build as you go. By the end you will have a fully-functioning web page and some cool programs that demonstrate what you&#39;ve learned, like how to:</p><h3>Look Professional</h3><p>By using a &quot;styling&quot; language called CSS, you will be able to quickly and easily change the look and feel of your web page. While learning CSS, you&#39;ll also gain experience with one of the most important concepts in computer science: avoiding repetition through something called <em>abstraction</em>. </p><h3>Display Videos</h3><p>In addition to your own notes about what you&#39;re learning, you&#39;ll learn to write computer code in a language called Python that will embed your favorite videos (from Udacity or anywhere else) directly onto a web page. While learning  Python, you&#39;ll be developing a skill that&#39;s required for every programming project regardless of language: using procedural thinking to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do.</p><h3>Be User-Friendly</h3><p>Even though <em>you</em> will have the skills to modify your web page by changing the code it&#39;s made from, the people you show it to may not. You&#39;ll add a form that allows visitors to add their own content to your page (if you let them of course). While you&#39;re learning what to do with information that someone submits to your web page, you&#39;ll also gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and how computer programmers assemble complex programs by combining pieces of computer code that others have written before them. </p><h2>How You Will Learn to Build it</h2><p>This Nanodegree consists of a series of 5 stages. In each one, you will learn new broadly-applicable technical skills. After each stage, you will complete a project checkpoint, then submit your work for valuable feedback on your progress.  </p><h3>Stage 1: Make Your Web Page</h3><p>You will learn the basics of how the internet works and how documents written in a language called HTML form the backbone of the Web. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> at the end you&#39;ll <em>write HTML and CSS (another language) to make your web page look professional.</em></p><h3>Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz</h3><p>This is where you&#39;ll learn how to program. You&#39;ll learn a programming language called Python and you&#39;ll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this stage you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will <em>write a program in Python to build a fill-in-the blanks type quiz.</em></p><h3>Stage 3: Create a Movie Website</h3><p>In this stage, you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will create a simple movies webpage with images and trailers.*</p><h3>Stage 4: Allow Comments</h3><p>Up to this point, you still haven&#39;t put your web page online: you&#39;ve only seen it on your own computer. In this stage, you will gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and will write code which tells computers called &quot;servers&quot; how to display web pages. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will <em>put your web page online and build what&#39;s called a &quot;back end&quot; which will allow people anywhere in the world to view and--if you let them--modify your site.</em></p><h3>Stage 5: Choose Your Next Steps</h3><p>At this point, you will already have a solid understanding of most of the essential concepts and skills that programming requires. This stage will be a rapid sampling of some of the ideas that you haven&#39;t seen including:</p><ul><li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: the language of the web.</li><li><strong>APIs</strong>: &quot;Application Programming Interfaces&quot; give programmers a way to easily incorporate data from all over the web into their applications.</li><li><strong>Recursion</strong>: This may be the most mind-blowing idea in programming.</li><li><strong>Parallel Computing</strong>: How to use many computers to solve really big problems more efficiently.</li><li><strong>How to Solve Big Problems</strong>: You run into new challenges when you write large programs (or building substantial web pages). </li><li><strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>: How to make your web page look good on a computer, tablet, or phone.</li></ul><p>In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will have the chance to <em>pursue one of these ideas even deeper by adding new functionality (you get to choose what) to your web page.</em></p>",
