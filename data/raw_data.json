This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it!

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

This course is designed to teach web developers what they need to know to create great cross-device mobile web experiences. This course will focus on building mobile web apps, which will work across multiple platforms including Android, iOS, and others.</p>",
      "syllabus": "<p>In this course, you will learn how to build web experiences that adapt to the different screen sizes and capabilities that mobile devices offer, and how to scalably optimize media for mobile and desktop.  We will cover programming touch interaction, as well as how to optimize form field input for mobile devices and use APIs like geolocation and the accelerometer, and ensuring your web experiences work great when network conditions are sub-optimal.  Finally, you\u2019ll gain the tools to investigate performance in mobile applications, with a strong understanding of mobile networking, battery usage patterns and optimizing paint techniques to build smooth animations on mobile.</p><h3>Lesson 01: Syllabus</h3><p>We\u2019ll start with a high-level overview of the course and what to expect in it. We\u2019ll also go into more depth on what we mean by mobile web development, and why you should care about it.</p><h3>Lesson 02: Mobile Development Tools</h3><p>Workflow and tooling is incredibly important for building great web apps, and this carries over to mobile web development. This lesson will show you how to use the Chrome Developer Tools to develop for the mobile web.</p><h3>Lesson 03: Mobile UX and Viewport</h3><p>Designing for the mobile web is all about a smooth user experience. This lesson will get you thinking about how to achieve that on mobile, and we\u2019ll introduce the first of many tools you need to achieve this: the viewport.</p><h3>Lesson 04: Fluid Design</h3><p>Mobile means lots of different devices and form factors. We\u2019ll discuss how to make your site responsive, clean, and user-friendly on multiple devices and layouts.</p><h3>Lesson 05: Media Queries</h3><p>Sometimes different devices call for fundamentally different layouts. This lesson will teach you how to achieve this using media queries.</p><h3>Lesson 06: Responsive Images</h3><p>Media requirements are different in mobile - network constraints and very high resolution screens set up a conflict that can be challenging.  We\u2019ll talk about how best to integrate media into your mobile web applications, and adaptively scaling images based on the environment.</p><h3>Lesson 07: Optimizing Performance</h3><p>Users expect a fast, seamless experience on mobile. We\u2019ll go over optimizing various performance metrics to improve that experience, such as network, cpu, rendering, and battery performance.</p><h3>Lesson 08: Touch</h3><p>Touch input is fundamentally different from mouse input, and requires you to think about your user interactions differently. We\u2019ll go over UX concerns with touch-based interaction, and how to design user interactions that work across devices.</p><h3>Lesson 09: Input</h3><p>Using a keyboard on mobile is awful. We\u2019ll discuss ways to improve it, using semantic input for form data, and other user input options on mobile.</p><h3>Lesson 10: Device Access</h3><p>Mobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop. We\u2019ll talk about camera access, geolocation, and other sensors and feedback you have access to on mobile.</p><h3>Lesson 11: Offline and Storage</h3><p>It\u2019s an unfortunate reality that mobile users aren\u2019t always online. We\u2019ll go over using the local cache as well as local storage APIs to give your users a great offline (and partially-online) experience as well.</p><h3>Lesson 12: Wrap-up</h3><p>We\u2019ll finish up the class by talking briefly about other topics to consider, such as app experience, monetization, deployment and distribution. We\u2019ll also point you to other resources to look at moving forward in your career.</p>",

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions?

This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it!

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

Next, you will train that model so it can decode sequences of digits from natural images by using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. After the model is properly trained, you will then test your model using a live camera application (optional) or program on newly-captured images. Finally, once you obtain meaningful results, you will refine your implementation to also localize where numbers are on the image, and test this localization on newly-captured images.</p>",

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

Many startups fail by not validating their ideas early on with real-life customers. In order to mitigate that, students will learn how to get out of the building and search for the real pain points and unmet needs of customers. Only with these can the entrepreneur find a proper solution and establish a suitable business model.</p><p>Building a startup is not simply building an execution plan for a business model that the entrepreneur thinks will work, but rather, a search for the actual business model itself.</p>",

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

      "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

After that, we\u2019ll teach you how to allow users to login, have data associated with them and send them notifications. You\u2019ll learn how to use Firebase\u2019s Security and Rules language to secure and add permissions to your data.</p><p>Firebase Remote Config gives you the ability to tune and customize your app without having to publish a new version. Finally we\u2019ll give you a brief overview of Firebase Analytics so you can collect data from the start. </p><p>Got extra time this weekend? As a bonus, you will write your own Cloud Function for Firebase that makes chat more fun by adding emojis to FriendlyChat conversations. Cloud Functions for Firebase integrates the Firebase platform by letting you write code that responds to events and invokes functionality exposed by other Firebase features.</p><p>By the end of this course you will have an Android application that can store and share data between different users in real time as well as authenticate and authorize those users.</p>",

You will also learn to use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) as an alternative to SQL.<br><h3>Lesson 2 - Making a Web Server</h3><br><p>In the second lesson, you will build a web server from scratch using Python and some of the pre-installed libraries it includes. You will learn what GET and POST requests are and how we use them to retrieve and modify information on a web site. We will then use the concepts learned in Lesson 1 to add CRUD functionality to our website.<br><h3>Lesson 3 - Developing with Frameworks</h3><br>In the third lesson, we will discuss web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails. You will see how web frameworks simplify the development process and allow us to create web applications faster. We will use the Flask web framework to develop our own web application. We will also discuss API&#39;s (Application Programming Interfaces) and add JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) endpoints to our application to allow data to be sent in a format alternative to HTML. <br><h3>Lesson 4 - Iterative Development</h3><br>In the last lesson, you will build an entire web application on your own. You will learn about the iterative development process and how developing iteratively allows you to have a working prototype throughout all stages of the development process.</p>",

It answers questions like, which type of chart should I use for an analysis? Or what colors are best? How do I communicate with using size, shape, etc.? You\u2019ll learn more about the importance of limited the amount of data presented in an analysis, and how to use data with integrity.</p><h3>Lesson 3 \u2013 Creating Visualizations with Tableau</h3><p>In this lesson, you&#39;ll learn how to use Tableau to create basic visualizations. First, you&#39;ll learn how to import data and create basic charts. Then, you&#39;ll use colors, shapes, and other tools to dig deep into data. Finally, you&#39;ll use calculations to create new data columns from existing data.</p><h3>Lesson 4 \u2013 Telling Stories with Tableau</h3><p>You create visualizations to tell stories with your data. Tableau enables this through creating dashboards and narrated stories. In this lesson, you&#39;ll learn how to build dashboards and stories with individual figures.</p>",

      "syllabus": "<p>You\u2019ll learn how to start with a question and/or a dataset, and use machine learning to turn them into insights. </p><h3>Lessons 1-4: Supervised Classification</h3><p><strong>Naive Bayes:</strong> We jump in headfirst, learning perhaps the world\u2019s greatest algorithm for classifying text.</p><p><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs):</strong> One of the top 10 algorithms in machine learning, and a must-try for many classification tasks.  What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.</p><p><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.</p><h3>Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions</h3><p>Behind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.</p><h3>Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers</h3><p>Regressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  What\u2019s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  We\u2019ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.</p><h3>Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning</h3><p><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> The flagship algorithm when you don\u2019t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.</p><h3>Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features</h3><p><strong>Feature Creation:</strong> Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.</p><p><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.</p><p><strong>Principal Component Analysis:</strong> A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.</p><p><strong>Feature Scaling:</strong> Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.<br>Learning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.</p><h3>Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation</h3><p><strong>Training/testing data split:</strong> How do you know that what you\u2019re doing is working?  You don\u2019t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.</p><p><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> Take the training/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.</p><p><strong>Precision, recall, and F1 score:</strong>  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.</p><h3>Lesson 15: Wrapping it all Up</h3><p>We take a step back and review what we\u2019ve learned, and how it all fits together.  </p><h3>Projects</h3><p>Mini-project at the end of each lesson</p><p><strong>Final project:</strong> searching for signs of corporate fraud in Enron data</p>",

      "syllabus": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>In this class you\u2019ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn\u2019t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).</p><p>There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don\u2019t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. </p><p>This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you&#39;ll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you&#39;ll put everything together.</p><h3>Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)</h3><p>What <strong>is</strong> Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?</p><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. </p><h3>Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)</h3><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You\u2019ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you\u2019ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you\u2019ll learn about:</p><ul><li><strong>Salesforce Data</strong>: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You\u2019ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. </li><li><strong>Relationships</strong>: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. </li><li><strong>Validation Rules</strong>: If you\u2019ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to build them into your app. </li><li><strong>Formulas and Summaries</strong>: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.<br></li></ul><h3>Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)</h3><p>Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you\u2019ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: </p><ul><li><strong>One-to-Many Relationships</strong>: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. </li><li><strong>Many-to-Many Relationships</strong>: You\u2019ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. </li><li><strong>Customizing the User Interface</strong>: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.</li><li><strong>Schema Builder</strong>: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you\u2019ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.</li><li><strong>Data Loading</strong>: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.</li></ul><h3>Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins)</h3><p>No matter what kind of app you\u2019re building, you\u2019ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you\u2019ll learn how to make:</p><ul><li><strong>Reports</strong>: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. </li><li><strong>Charts</strong>: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.</li><li><strong>Dashboards</strong>: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.</li><li><strong>Views</strong>: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.</li></ul><h3>Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)</h3><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You\u2019ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: </p><ul><li><strong>Workflows</strong>: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.</li><li><strong>Approval Processes</strong>: You don\u2019t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say \"this looks good.\" Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.</li></ul><h3>Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)</h3><p>This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you\u2019ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you\u2019ll use are:</p><ul><li><strong>Chatter</strong>: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.<br></li><li><strong>Salesforce1</strong>: That web app you\u2019ve been building this whole time? It\u2019s actually a mobile app too. You\u2019ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. </li></ul><h3>Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)</h3><p>By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it\u2019s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.</p>",

Solving these problems using AI means having access to a large amount of private and sensitive data.</p><p>Want to predict cancer in medical scans? If you're using traditional Deep Learning tools, this means persuading someone to send you a copy of a sensitive dataset. In many cases, this is either a non-starter or it will severely limit the amount of data you're allowed to see.</p><p>In this course, learn how to apply Deep Learning to private data while maintaining users' privacy, giving you the ability to train on more data in a privacy-preserving manner so that you can tackle more difficult problems and create smarter, more effective AI models, while also being socially responsible.</p>",

Two versions of the website are shown to different users - usually the existing website and a potential change. Then, the results are analyzed to determine whether the change is an improvement worth launching. This course will cover how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power, how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions, and how to ensure that the the participants of your experiments are adequately protected.</p>",
      "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1: Overview of A/B Testing</h3><p>This lesson will cover what A/B testing is and what it can be used for. It will also cover an example A/B test from start to finish, including how to decide how long to run the experiment, how to construct a binomial confidence interval for the results, and how to decide whether the change is worth the launch cost.</p><h3>Lesson 2: Policy and Ethics for Experiments</h3><p>This lesson will cover how to make sure the participants of your experiments are adequately protected and what questions you should be asking regarding the ethicality of experiments. It will cover four main ethics principles to consider when designing experiments: the risk to the user, the potential benefits, what alternatives users have to participating in the experiment, and the sensitivity of the data being collected.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Choosing and Characterizing Metrics</h3><p>One of the most important and time-consuming pieces of designing an A/B test is choosing and validating metrics to use in evaluating your experiment. This lesson will cover techniques for brainstorming metrics, what to do when you can&#39;t measure what you want directly, and characteristics you should consider when validating your metrics.</p><h3>Lesson 4: Designing an Experiment</h3><p>This lesson will cover how to design an A/B test. This includes how to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group - different online definitions of a &quot;user&quot;, and what effects different choices will have on your experiment. It will also cover when to  limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base, how to calculate how many events you will need in order to draw strong conclusions from your results, and how this translates into how long to run the experiment. Finally, the lesson will cover how various design decisions affect the size of your experiment, so you will know which decisions to revisit if you need results more quickly.</p><h3>Lesson 5: Analyzing Results</h3><p>This lesson will cover how to analyze the results of your experiments. Step one is always to run some sanity checks so that you can catch problems with your experiment set-up. Then, you will learn how to check conclusions with multiple methods, including a hypothesis test on the effect size and a binomial sign test, if you get results that surprise you. You will also learn how measuring multiple metrics for the same experiment can make analysis difficult, and some techniques for handling multiple metrics. Finally, you will learn about several analysis &quot;gotchas&quot;, and what to do if you see them, including how Simpson&#39;s Paradox can affect A/B tests, and why even statistically significant results might disappear when you launch.</p><h3>Final Project: Design and Analyze an A/B Test</h3><p>Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.</p><p>This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \"Scale\" really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you\u2019ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you\u2019ll need to do so.</p><p>The techniques you\u2019ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you\u2019ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you\u2019ll use include Cilk Plus, OpenMP, and MPI, and possibly others.)</p>",

You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user&#39;s browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow.</p><h3>Lesson 3 - Local Permission Systems</h3><p>Add python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider&#39;s API.</p><h3>Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook &amp; Other Providers</h3><p>Learn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application.

As smart phone like devices enable ubiquitous access to web and voice channels, the convergence of telephony with the Internet gives rise to new cross-channel threats that can combine online and voice attacks. For example, voice phishing with caller-id spoofing has been reported for stealing online banking credentials. His data-driven research approach for exploring cross-channel threats has resulted in better understanding of these threats and more effective ways to combat them. In the healthcare security area, he has worked on monitoring for detection of abuse and fraud.</p>",

You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to Computer Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Fundamentals with Python</a> courses are great places to get started.</p><p>Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended.

The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.</p><p>So why should you learn d3.js?</p><p>Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.</p><p>If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a <code>for</code> loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803\" target=\"_blank\">Javascript Basics</a> course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.</p>",

      "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1a Visualization Fundamentals (2 hours)</h3><p>Learn about the elements of great data visualization. In this lesson, you will meet data visualization experts, learn about data visualization in the context of data science, and learn how to represent data values in visual form.</p><h3>Lesson 1b D3 Building Blocks (4 hours)</h3><p>Learn how to use the open standards of the web to create graphical elements. You\u2019ll learn how to select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements. Make use of all the Instructor Notes throughout this lesson if you have little to no experience with HTML and CSS.</p><h3>Mini-Project 1: RAW Visualization (2 hours)</h3><p>Create a data visualization using a software of your choice. We will provide recommendations for visualization software as well as data sets. We want you to get right into making data visualization so here\u2019s your first chance!</p><h3>Lesson 2a Design Principles (2 hours)</h3><p>Which chart type should I use for my data? Which colors should I avoid when making graphics? How do I know if my graphic is effective? Investigate these questions, and learn about the World Cup data set which will be use throughout the rest of the course.</p><h3>Lesson 2b Dimple.js (4 hours)</h3><p>Learn how to create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library. You will learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about D3.js. You will be able to produce great graphics with minimal code, and all of your graphics will come with interactivity without any extra effort on your part. Dimple, it&#39;s simple!</p><h3>Mini-Project 2: Take Two (2-5 hours)</h3><p>Find an existing data visualization, critique it for what it does well and what it doesn\u2019t do well, and finally, recreate the graphic using a software tool of your choice. We recommend using Dimple.js, which is covered in Lesson 2b, but we don\u2019t want you to feel constrained by the choice of tools. Use any tool that works for you.</p><h3>Special Note</h3><p>At this point in the course, you can start the final project. The remaining content of the course covers narrative structures, types of bias, and maps. All of the code  in Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 pertains to d3.js. If you&#39;d like to learn d3.js and complete the final project using d3.js, then please continue. If you prefer to stop, you can complete the final project using dimple.js.</p><h3>Lesson 3 Narratives (5 hours)</h3><p>Learn how to incorporate different narrative structures into your visualizations and code along with Jonathan as you create a graphic for the World Cup data set. You\u2019ll learn about different types of bias in the data visualization process and learn how to add context to your data visualizations. By the end of this lesson, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation in D3.js.</p><h3>Lesson 4 Animation and Interaction (5 hours)</h3><p>Static graphics are great, but interactive graphics can be even better. Learn how to leverage animation and interaction to bring more data insights to your audience. Code along with Jonathan once again as you learn how to create a bubble map for the World Cup data set.</p><h3>Final Project: Making an Effective Data Visualization (2 hours or more)</h3><p>You will create a data visualization that conveys a clear message about a data set. You will use dimple.js or d3.js and collect feedback along the way to arrive at a polished product.</p><h4><b>NOTE:</b> As a free student, you are welcome to complete the project to showcase your learning; however, only students enrolled in the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002\" target=\"_blank\">Data Analyst Nanodegree</a> are able to submit the final project for review and certificate.

      "faq": "Before course development started, we asked you what questions you had about Apple's Swift language. Here are the answers to your most burning questions:\r\r### Why is the language called Swift?\rThe language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. \r\r### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?\rSwift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you won\u2019t miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.\r\r### How easy is Swift to learn?\rSwift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/\">According to Apple</a>, Swift is the \"first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.\" Some have even <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186/\" target=\"_blank\">called Swift the new BASIC</a>.\r\r### Is it fast?\r<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple boasts</a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.\r\r### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?\rObjective-C has been Apple\u2019s primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.\r\r### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?\rAbsolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.\r\r### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?\rAs mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show it\u2019s age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.\r\r### How Stable is Swift?\rAs with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.\r\rThe thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17\" target=\"_blank\">failable initializers</a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655\" target=\"_blank\">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*</a>.\r\r### What other languages is it similar to?\rSwift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though you\u2019ll also probably recognize some C syntax. \r\r### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?\rSwift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.",

You&#39;ll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project.</p><h3>Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours)</h3><p>EDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours)</h3><p>We perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations.</p><h3>Problem Set 3 (2 hours)</h3><h3>Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours)</h3><p>EDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We&#39;ll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means.</p><h3>Problem Set 4 (2 hours)</h3><h3>Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours)</h3><p>Data sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We&#39;ll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we&#39;ll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well.</p><h3>Problem Set 5 (2 hours)</h3><h3>Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours)</h3><p>Investigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He&#39;ll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project, you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice.</p><h3>Final Project (10+ hours)</h3><p>You&#39;ve explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set. Now, it&#39;s your turn to conduct your own exploratory data analysis. Choose one data set to explore (one provided by Udacity or your own) and create a RMD file that uncovers the patterns, anomalies and relationships of the data set.</p>",

He is developing adaptive programming languages, and trying to understand what it means to bring machine learning tools to non-expert authors, designers and developers.

Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i></p><p>This is a survey course designed to provide a broad, forward-facing overview of contemporary health informatics, a specialized field of computing that seeks to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. To understand health informatics (HIT) you also need to have at least a basic understanding of the complex and highly regulated US healthcare industry. The course is designed for students from diverse backgrounds and who have not been previously exposed to HIT. It is divided into three sections:</p><p>The US healthcare delivery and the key role of the federal government in promoting HIT adoption</p><p>The core technologies that drive all contemporary HIT systems and tools</p><p>The real world applications of HIT from electronic medical and personal health records to exploiting digital data aggregated from them for research and other purposes</p>",
      "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1: The US Healthcare System</h3><p>This lesson will discuss unique and the complex nature of the US healthcare system: its key problems, the specific challenges presented by chronic disease, the major disconnect between the health system\u2019s capabilities and the demands of chronic disease management, and the hope that a combination of new incentives, health IT adoption, and new models of care can bridge this disconnect leading to a more efficient, effective, safer and more patient-centered US system of care.</p><h3>Lesson 2: Federal Policies &amp; Initiatives</h3><p>This lesson will focus on the important details of the specific programs that the federal government has put into place to spur health IT adoption by eligible providers and hospitals as well as the role played by financial incentives that reward performance, rather than the quantity of procedures. </p><h3>Lesson 3: Health Information Exchange</h3><p>This lesson will focus on the rationale for and the major challenges of health information exchange (HIE). We will discuss the various ways of classifying HIE, how to differentiate the various HIE architectures, and the Indiana Health Information Exchange as a premier example including descriptions of its key services. We will discuss new approaches and technologies with a particular emphasis on Direct HIE, a new technology based on secure email and encrypted attachments.</p><h3>Lesson 4: Privacy, Security and Trust</h3><p>This lesson focuses on the keys issues of privacy, security, and trust in a world of digital records and health information exchange. Students will understand the key role that patient engagement plays in chronic disease prevention and management and the concerns patients have about sharing their health data. They will also explore the various privacy consent models. Data segmentation will be discussed as a key challenge for obtaining patient consent under what may be the most acceptable model. The concept of public key infrastructure (PKI) including the roles of the public key, private key, registration authority and certificate authority will be covered.</p><h3>Lesson 5A: Data Standards</h3><p>We divide the discussion of standards into those for health data and those for achieving its sharing by fostering interoperability. This lesson  focuses on data standards after reviewing the rationale for standards and the evolutions that have been taking place in their use, technology and structure. Students will be able to recognize the difference between a classification and an ontology.  They will be familiar with the key data standards (including ICD, CPT, LOINC and SNOMED). They will also gain an overview of the differences between standards based on EDI/X12 and XML.</p><h3>Lesson 5B: Interoperability Standards</h3><p>This lesson builds on Lesson 5A on data standards to show how these data are transmitted within messages using HL7 and packaged into CCDA-based clinical documents for sharing via HIE. We\u2019ll briefly introduce even more advanced standards with a particular emphasis on clinical decision support (CDS, an important technology for the future) and the key elements of and remaining challenges with standards to support CDS. We\u2019ll also discuss more facile next generation approaches based on web technologies and approaches. </p><h3>Lesson 6: Clinical Data Collection and Visualization Challenges</h3><p>Students should understand the key roles that data plays in medical practice and the root causes of common data quality issues in general and the specific root causes of data quality issues with respect to electronic health records. They should understand the high level challenges of efficiently and accurately collecting high quality, comprehensive clinical data from physicians and of visualizing digital health data in a way that supports the provider\u2019s mental model. They should understand the key roles that information technology plays in the future vision of healthcare.</p><h3>Lesson 7: Empowering the Patient</h3><p>Students should understand the key role that support for patients can play so they can achieve behavior change, adhere to their prescribed treatments and generate data to help their providers more continuously manage their chronic diseases. They should understand patient interests. They should understand the key information technology tools now available to patients including patient health records, portals, social networking, in home technologies and mobile devices and sensors. They should have a detailed functional understanding of personal health records and their potential as app platforms. They should understand the potential role of social networking in patient education and care management. They should understand the various telemedicine modalities being developed and offered for use by patients at home.</p><h3>Lesson 8: Population Health Management</h3><p>Students should understand the difference between individual patient management, population management and public health. They should understand the technologies for aggregating data, the kinds of data that are collected and the kinds of reports that are required for population and public health management.</p><h3>Lesson 9: Data Query in a Federated Environment</h3><p>Students should understand the challenges of data query and aggregation in an environment where care providers are using disparate and non-interoperable EHRs. They should be familiar with and understand the differences among the distributed query technologies. They should be familiar with the distributed query standards and the various open source query frameworks reviewed in this lesson.</p><h3>Lesson 10: Big Data Meets Healthcare</h3><p>Students should understand the concept of \"big data\"; the common technical approaches to modeling and simulation and the common applications of each. They should be familiar with the specific case studies of analytic applications to healthcare problems as diverse as improved clinical decision support, understanding clinical processes, modeling care spaces and providing optimal patient-specific treatments.</p>",

In this lesson you\u2019ll learn the XML markup language used to lay out Android applications. You\u2019ll create views, the basic building block of Android layouts, that display text and images. Then you\u2019ll position your text and images on these screens. This highly interactive lesson encourages experimentation through coding challenges in Udacity\u2019s XML Visualizer.</p><h2>Practice Set 1</h2><p>Create a birthday card application for your phone. You\u2019ll start by installing Android Studio, a program used by professional developers to make Android applications. You\u2019ll then transfer a simple application you create from your computer to your phone. Following that, you\u2019ll take all the concepts you learned in Lesson 1 to build your birthday card app, and install it on your phone for your friends and family to see.</p>",

In Lessons 1 and 2, you will learn widely applicable design principles and techniques like high-level UX planning and user-centered design.</p><p>In Lessons 3 and 4, you will focus on design ideas specific to mobile/Android development. Mobile platforms all come with a unique set of constraints and opportunities and this lesson will help you respect those constraints while taking advantage of the opportunities. </p><h3>Lessons</h3><h4>Lesson 1: What is User Experience?</h4><p>In this lesson you will think about User Experience from the highest level. You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on). </p><p><em>Topics covered:</em></p><ul><li>What is UX?</li><li>UI vs. UX</li><li>High-level planning</li><li>Low-fi wireframing and prototyping</li><li>Two concrete app improvements to implement now</li></ul><h4>Lesson 2: User-Centered Design</h4><p>In this lesson you will learn how to design apps that your users will love. You will learn the importance of user-centered design, what happens when you design for everyone/no one (spoiler alert: it\u2019s generally bad), and how to effectively use tools like personas and use cases to ensure a baseline level of quality for anything you build.

You\u2019ll learn about easy-to-implement performance gains and develop a simple and powerful model for uncovering optimization opportunities.</p><p>You\u2019ll put your newfound performance skillset to the test with the final project, where you\u2019ll be optimizing your own online portfolio website!</p><h2>Lessons</h2><h3>Lesson 0 (20 minutes)</h3><p>You can\u2019t optimize what you can\u2019t measure, so in this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to open Chrome Developer Tools to measure the performance of mobile and desktop websites.</p><h3>Lesson 1 (60 minutes)</h3><p>Optimizing any website\u2019s performance requires a strong understanding of how browsers build websites from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You\u2019ll start by breaking down the <strong>Critical Rendering Path</strong> - the steps the browser has to take to render a page. You\u2019ll get an understanding of how:</p><ul><li><strong>HTML</strong> is converted to the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.</li><li><strong>CSS</strong> is converted to the <strong>CSS Object Model (CSSOM)</strong>.</li><li>the browser runs <strong>layout</strong> to determine the position and size of elements before <strong>painting</strong> pixels on the screen.</li></ul><p>Throughout the lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to take advantage of the Timeline view in <strong>Chrome Developer Tools</strong> to measure each and every step\u2019s performance on mobile and desktop.</p><h3>Lesson 2 (90 minutes)</h3><p>You\u2019ll explore easy HTML, CSS and JavaScript optimizations with significant performance implications, some of which are as simple as adding a single attribute to an HTML tag! Along the way, you\u2019ll be developing the skills to help you diagnose opportunities for optimizations, including:</p><ul><li>building <strong>quick and dirty</strong> diagrams of the Critical Rendering Path.</li><li>identifying <strong>three key metrics</strong> to triangulate potential performance bottlenecks.</li></ul>",

You\u2019ll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. </p><h2>Lesson 3: Semantics Basics</h2><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can&#39;t see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. You\u2019ll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. You\u2019ll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. </p><h2>Lesson 4: Semantics Extras</h2><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. You\u2019ll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! You\u2019ll also learn how to call out \"landmarks\" into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this \"semantic markup\"  also makes your markup more readable!)</p><h2>Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIA</h2><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and that\u2019s where ARIA comes in \u2013 Accessible Rich Internet Applications. You\u2019ll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.</p><h2>Lesson 6: Style</h2><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your page\u2019s styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. You\u2019ll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.</p>",

      "syllabus": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>This course consists of 5 lessons. The first one is an overview of responsive design and introduces the way you\u2019ll need to shift your thinking as you go from desktop first design, to responsive design.  Lessons 2, 3, 4 and 5 will cover the important theoretical concepts of responsive design, and include plenty of hands-on exercises implementing what you\u2019ve learned.  </p><h3>Lesson 1 - Why Responsive?</h3><p>What is responsive web design and why is it important? What kinds of devices should we be targeting with our design? How can we best leverage the different capabilities of each device to provide great experiences to users? You\u2019ll also make sure that your development environment is ready to go. </p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>What is responsive design?</li><li>Why does responsive design work for any device?</li><li>Remote debugging and emulation in the browser</li></ul><h3>Lesson 2 - Starting Small</h3><p>The best way to get started is to start small and build up. In this lesson, we\u2019ll cover the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport.  You\u2019ll start the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.  </p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>Why start small and build up?</li><li>What is the viewport?</li><li>Sizing the content to the viewport<ul><li>avoiding static sized items</li></ul></li><li>Touch targets, and why they should be large</li></ul><h3>Lesson 3 - Building Up</h3><p>Once you\u2019ve got a page optimized for small screens, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how they\u2019ll look on larger screens.  Learn how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.</p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>CSS media queries</li><li>What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one</li><li>Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout</li></ul><h3>Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns</h3><p>Now that you\u2019ve got the basics of responsive design down, you\u2019ll learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. You&#39;ll also iterate on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.</p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>Mostly fluid pattern</li><li>Column drop pattern</li><li>Layout shifter pattern</li><li>Off canvas pattern</li></ul><h3>Lesson 5 - Optimizations</h3><p>Learn strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. You\u2019ll also learn about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, you&#39;ll iterate for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.</p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>Minor break points</li><li>Optimizing text layout<ul><li>font size</li><li>optimal line length</li></ul></li><li>Responsive tables, and strategies for dealing with them</li></ul>",

You&#39;ll be a master of the cache! Your web apps will interact with the network just like native apps do.

We\u2019ll teach you how to turn a vague question into a statistical one that can be analyzed with statistics and machine learning. You will also analyze a Twitter dataset and try to predict when a person will tweet next! </p><h3>Lesson 3 - Modeling Phase</h3><p>Building upon lesson 2, you will learn how to build rigorous mathematical, statistical, and machine learning models so you can make accurate predictions. You look through the recently released U.S. medicare dataset for anomalous transactions.</p><h3>Lesson 4 - Validation Phase</h3><p>So how do you tell if your model is doing well? In this lesson, we will teach you some of the fundamental and important metrics that you can use to grade the performance of the models that you\u2019ve build. You will analyze the AT&amp;T connected cars data set and see if you can tell which driver is which by analyzing their driving patterns.</p><h3>Final Project - Identify Hacking Attempts from Network Flow Logs</h3><p>You will create a program that examines log data of net flow traffic, and produces a score, from 1 to 10, describing the degree to which the logs suggest a brute force attack is taking place on a server.</p>",

This course introduces not only the enormous design space offered by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) but also the trade-off that must be struck with indispensable safety requirements. Powerful CPS design frameworks are introduced to perform this trade-off, ranging from hardware to software engineering and from system design to validation.</p>",

Then, we&#39;ll discuss a paradigm that will help us in the future, and we\u2019ll see some examples of that paradigm in action.</p><h3>Lesson 2: Refactoring</h3><p>We&#39;ll spend some time discussing how our new paradigm applies to the project we worked on in Lesson 1. Then we&#39;ll rebuild the project with the new organizational paradigm.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Using an Organizational Library</h3><p>We&#39;ll explore how to use KnockoutJS, an organizational library, to organize our code and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code we write. Our resulting application will be well-organized, easy to understand, and extendable.</p><h3>Lesson 4: Exploring Unfamiliar Code</h3><p>In this final lesson, we&#39;ll spend some time talking about how to explore code that you didn&#39;t write, possibly even using a library or framework that you aren&#39;t familiar with. Exploration is one of the most important skills for a developer to foster. and this lesson will get you started on that journey.</p>",

      "syllabus": "<h2>What You Will Build</h2><p>As you progress through this Nanodegree you will document what you&#39;re learning in a web page that you&#39;ll build as you go. By the end you will have a fully-functioning web page and some cool programs that demonstrate what you&#39;ve learned, like how to:</p><h3>Look Professional</h3><p>By using a &quot;styling&quot; language called CSS, you will be able to quickly and easily change the look and feel of your web page. While learning CSS, you&#39;ll also gain experience with one of the most important concepts in computer science: avoiding repetition through something called <em>abstraction</em>. </p><h3>Display Videos</h3><p>In addition to your own notes about what you&#39;re learning, you&#39;ll learn to write computer code in a language called Python that will embed your favorite videos (from Udacity or anywhere else) directly onto a web page. While learning  Python, you&#39;ll be developing a skill that&#39;s required for every programming project regardless of language: using procedural thinking to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do.</p><h3>Be User-Friendly</h3><p>Even though <em>you</em> will have the skills to modify your web page by changing the code it&#39;s made from, the people you show it to may not. You&#39;ll add a form that allows visitors to add their own content to your page (if you let them of course). While you&#39;re learning what to do with information that someone submits to your web page, you&#39;ll also gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and how computer programmers assemble complex programs by combining pieces of computer code that others have written before them. </p><h2>How You Will Learn to Build it</h2><p>This Nanodegree consists of a series of 5 stages. In each one, you will learn new broadly-applicable technical skills. After each stage, you will complete a project checkpoint, then submit your work for valuable feedback on your progress.  </p><h3>Stage 1: Make Your Web Page</h3><p>You will learn the basics of how the internet works and how documents written in a language called HTML form the backbone of the Web. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> at the end you&#39;ll <em>write HTML and CSS (another language) to make your web page look professional.</em></p><h3>Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz</h3><p>This is where you&#39;ll learn how to program. You&#39;ll learn a programming language called Python and you&#39;ll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this stage you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will <em>write a program in Python to build a fill-in-the blanks type quiz.</em></p><h3>Stage 3: Create a Movie Website</h3><p>In this stage, you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will create a simple movies webpage with images and trailers.*</p><h3>Stage 4: Allow Comments</h3><p>Up to this point, you still haven&#39;t put your web page online: you&#39;ve only seen it on your own computer. In this stage, you will gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and will write code which tells computers called &quot;servers&quot; how to display web pages. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will <em>put your web page online and build what&#39;s called a &quot;back end&quot; which will allow people anywhere in the world to view and--if you let them--modify your site.</em></p><h3>Stage 5: Choose Your Next Steps</h3><p>At this point, you will already have a solid understanding of most of the essential concepts and skills that programming requires. This stage will be a rapid sampling of some of the ideas that you haven&#39;t seen including:</p><ul><li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: the language of the web.</li><li><strong>APIs</strong>: &quot;Application Programming Interfaces&quot; give programmers a way to easily incorporate data from all over the web into their applications.</li><li><strong>Recursion</strong>: This may be the most mind-blowing idea in programming.</li><li><strong>Parallel Computing</strong>: How to use many computers to solve really big problems more efficiently.</li><li><strong>How to Solve Big Problems</strong>: You run into new challenges when you write large programs (or building substantial web pages). </li><li><strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>: How to make your web page look good on a computer, tablet, or phone.</li></ul><p>In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will have the chance to <em>pursue one of these ideas even deeper by adding new functionality (you get to choose what) to your web page.</em></p>",

Depending on your knowledge and skill level, you can either learn the necessary skills through our supporting courses, or jump into building the apps directly. A summary of each of these apps, as well as a link to their supporting course are included in the sections below.</p><h3>Pitch Perfect</h3><p>Ever wondered what you\u2019d sound like as a Chipmunk or Darth Vader? Wonder no more! In this first project, you\u2019ll build an app that records a user\u2019s voice and then plays the modulated audio through a variety of filters.</p><h3>MemeMe</h3><p>Solidify your knowledge of iOS user interface concepts by building an app that creates memes from images! The project is split into two parts. In part 1, you\u2019ll create an app that enables the user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share the meme with friends. In part 2, you\u2019ll display sent memes in both a table and collection view.</p><h3>On the Map</h3><p>By incorporating networking, apps truly become \"mobile\" -- interacting with interesting data using popular web services. In this project, you\u2019ll build your first networked app that displays information posted by other Udacity students. You\u2019ll create a map view with pins representing student locations, and by tapping a pin, the app will display a custom URL posted by a student.</p><h3>Virtual Tourist</h3><p>Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch! In this project, you\u2019ll build an app that lets you tour the world from the comfort of your own couch. Users will be able to drop pins on a map, download pictures for the location, and save favorites to their device.</p><h3>You Decide!</h3><p>Landing a job as an iOS Developer requires more than technical skills; it requires creativity and innovation. Drawing on everything you\u2019ve learned so far in the Nanodegree, you&#39;ll now dream up, design, and code your own custom app.</p>",
