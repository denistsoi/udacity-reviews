    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

Though this is a very specific app use case, the skills you learn will be applicable to just about any business app you\u2019d want to develop.</p>",
    "syllabus": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>In this class you\u2019ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn\u2019t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).</p><p>There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don\u2019t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. </p><p>This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you&#39;ll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you&#39;ll put everything together.</p><h3>Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)</h3><p>What <strong>is</strong> Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?</p><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. </p><h3>Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)</h3><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You\u2019ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you\u2019ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you\u2019ll learn about:</p><ul><li><strong>Salesforce Data</strong>: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You\u2019ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. </li><li><strong>Relationships</strong>: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. </li><li><strong>Validation Rules</strong>: If you\u2019ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to build them into your app. </li><li><strong>Formulas and Summaries</strong>: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.<br></li></ul><h3>Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)</h3><p>Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you\u2019ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: </p><ul><li><strong>One-to-Many Relationships</strong>: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. </li><li><strong>Many-to-Many Relationships</strong>: You\u2019ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. </li><li><strong>Customizing the User Interface</strong>: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.</li><li><strong>Schema Builder</strong>: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you\u2019ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.</li><li><strong>Data Loading</strong>: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.</li></ul><h3>Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins)</h3><p>No matter what kind of app you\u2019re building, you\u2019ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you\u2019ll learn how to make:</p><ul><li><strong>Reports</strong>: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. </li><li><strong>Charts</strong>: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.</li><li><strong>Dashboards</strong>: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.</li><li><strong>Views</strong>: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.</li></ul><h3>Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)</h3><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You\u2019ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: </p><ul><li><strong>Workflows</strong>: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.</li><li><strong>Approval Processes</strong>: You don\u2019t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say \"this looks good.\" Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.</li></ul><h3>Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)</h3><p>This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you\u2019ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you\u2019ll use are:</p><ul><li><strong>Chatter</strong>: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.<br></li><li><strong>Salesforce1</strong>: That web app you\u2019ve been building this whole time? It\u2019s actually a mobile app too. You\u2019ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. </li></ul><h3>Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)</h3><p>By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it\u2019s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.</p>",

To understand health informatics (HIT) you also need to have at least a basic understanding of the complex and highly regulated US healthcare industry. The course is designed for students from diverse backgrounds and who have not been previously exposed to HIT. It is divided into three sections:</p><p>The US healthcare delivery and the key role of the federal government in promoting HIT adoption</p><p>The core technologies that drive all contemporary HIT systems and tools</p><p>The real world applications of HIT from electronic medical and personal health records to exploiting digital data aggregated from them for research and other purposes</p>",
    "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1: The US Healthcare System</h3><p>This lesson will discuss unique and the complex nature of the US healthcare system: its key problems, the specific challenges presented by chronic disease, the major disconnect between the health system\u2019s capabilities and the demands of chronic disease management, and the hope that a combination of new incentives, health IT adoption, and new models of care can bridge this disconnect leading to a more efficient, effective, safer and more patient-centered US system of care.</p><h3>Lesson 2: Federal Policies &amp; Initiatives</h3><p>This lesson will focus on the important details of the specific programs that the federal government has put into place to spur health IT adoption by eligible providers and hospitals as well as the role played by financial incentives that reward performance, rather than the quantity of procedures. </p><h3>Lesson 3: Health Information Exchange</h3><p>This lesson will focus on the rationale for and the major challenges of health information exchange (HIE). We will discuss the various ways of classifying HIE, how to differentiate the various HIE architectures, and the Indiana Health Information Exchange as a premier example including descriptions of its key services. We will discuss new approaches and technologies with a particular emphasis on Direct HIE, a new technology based on secure email and encrypted attachments.</p><h3>Lesson 4: Privacy, Security and Trust</h3><p>This lesson focuses on the keys issues of privacy, security, and trust in a world of digital records and health information exchange. Students will understand the key role that patient engagement plays in chronic disease prevention and management and the concerns patients have about sharing their health data. They will also explore the various privacy consent models. Data segmentation will be discussed as a key challenge for obtaining patient consent under what may be the most acceptable model. The concept of public key infrastructure (PKI) including the roles of the public key, private key, registration authority and certificate authority will be covered.</p><h3>Lesson 5A: Data Standards</h3><p>We divide the discussion of standards into those for health data and those for achieving its sharing by fostering interoperability. This lesson  focuses on data standards after reviewing the rationale for standards and the evolutions that have been taking place in their use, technology and structure. Students will be able to recognize the difference between a classification and an ontology.  They will be familiar with the key data standards (including ICD, CPT, LOINC and SNOMED). They will also gain an overview of the differences between standards based on EDI/X12 and XML.</p><h3>Lesson 5B: Interoperability Standards</h3><p>This lesson builds on Lesson 5A on data standards to show how these data are transmitted within messages using HL7 and packaged into CCDA-based clinical documents for sharing via HIE. We\u2019ll briefly introduce even more advanced standards with a particular emphasis on clinical decision support (CDS, an important technology for the future) and the key elements of and remaining challenges with standards to support CDS. We\u2019ll also discuss more facile next generation approaches based on web technologies and approaches. </p><h3>Lesson 6: Clinical Data Collection and Visualization Challenges</h3><p>Students should understand the key roles that data plays in medical practice and the root causes of common data quality issues in general and the specific root causes of data quality issues with respect to electronic health records. They should understand the high level challenges of efficiently and accurately collecting high quality, comprehensive clinical data from physicians and of visualizing digital health data in a way that supports the provider\u2019s mental model. They should understand the key roles that information technology plays in the future vision of healthcare.</p><h3>Lesson 7: Empowering the Patient</h3><p>Students should understand the key role that support for patients can play so they can achieve behavior change, adhere to their prescribed treatments and generate data to help their providers more continuously manage their chronic diseases. They should understand patient interests. They should understand the key information technology tools now available to patients including patient health records, portals, social networking, in home technologies and mobile devices and sensors. They should have a detailed functional understanding of personal health records and their potential as app platforms. They should understand the potential role of social networking in patient education and care management. They should understand the various telemedicine modalities being developed and offered for use by patients at home.</p><h3>Lesson 8: Population Health Management</h3><p>Students should understand the difference between individual patient management, population management and public health. They should understand the technologies for aggregating data, the kinds of data that are collected and the kinds of reports that are required for population and public health management.</p><h3>Lesson 9: Data Query in a Federated Environment</h3><p>Students should understand the challenges of data query and aggregation in an environment where care providers are using disparate and non-interoperable EHRs. They should be familiar with and understand the differences among the distributed query technologies. They should be familiar with the distributed query standards and the various open source query frameworks reviewed in this lesson.</p><h3>Lesson 10: Big Data Meets Healthcare</h3><p>Students should understand the concept of \"big data\"; the common technical approaches to modeling and simulation and the common applications of each. They should be familiar with the specific case studies of analytic applications to healthcare problems as diverse as improved clinical decision support, understanding clinical processes, modeling care spaces and providing optimal patient-specific treatments.</p>",

You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on). </p><p><em>Topics covered:</em></p><ul><li>What is UX?</li><li>UI vs. UX</li><li>High-level planning</li><li>Low-fi wireframing and prototyping</li><li>Two concrete app improvements to implement now</li></ul><h4>Lesson 2: User-Centered Design</h4><p>In this lesson you will learn how to design apps that your users will love. You will learn the importance of user-centered design, what happens when you design for everyone/no one (spoiler alert: it\u2019s generally bad), and how to effectively use tools like personas and use cases to ensure a baseline level of quality for anything you build. You will also learn a bit about how to use cheap and easy user research techniques to make well-informed design decisions. </p><p><em>Topics covered:</em></p><ul><li>The perils of ignoring your user</li><li>How to create effective personas and use cases</li><li>Low cost user research</li><li>How to use personas and use cases to inform feature lists</li></ul><h4>Lesson 3: Designing for Mobile Constraints</h4><p>Mobile design and development come with constraints and opportunities. This lesson is about the constraints. You will learn what constraints are inherent to mobile development and how to use design tools and techniques to ensure your app actually respects those constraints. </p><p><em>Topics covered:</em></p><ul><li>The 5 big constraints: limited data, finite battery, hand-held usage, divided user attention, and small screens.</li><li>The implications of these constraints and what happens when you get them wrong.</li><li>Advanced wireframing</li></ul><h4>Lesson 4: Designing for Android Delight</h4><p>At this point, you will already know how to make a solid mobile app that users like. But like isn\u2019t enough! In order to be really successful, your app needs to be <em>loved</em>. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to leverage the power of Android by using device sensors and Google APIs to understand your user\u2019s context.</p><p><em>Topics covered:</em></p><ul><li>Android sensors</li><li>The importance of contextual apps</li><li>The \"components\" of context</li><li>Android APIs (Google Play Services)</li></ul><h3>Final Project</h3><p>In your final project, you will create high/mid-level design specifications for your own incredible Android app. You&#39;ll begin work on this project in the Assignments for Lesson 2, and continue working on it until the end of the course. </p><p>When it&#39;s finished, you will have the blueprint for an app that will:</p><ul><li>Be designed for a specific target user.</li><li>Have an almost-perfect high level flow.</li><li>Avoid all major mobile pitfalls.</li><li>Use Android sensors and APIs to understand your user&#39;s context and deliver context-aware moments of amazement that they will love.</li></ul>",

Your journey through the fascinating world of deep reinforcement learning will start at the very beginning. So, we\u2019ll begin by answering the question: what is deep reinforcement learning, exactly? Well, reinforcement learning is ultimately about building code that can figure out how to perform complex tasks by itself. And deep reinforcement learning refers to approaches where the knowledge that the code builds over time is represented with a deep neural network.",
