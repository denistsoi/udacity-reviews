    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

Next, you will train that model so it can decode sequences of digits from natural images by using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.

    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

    "summary": "<p>The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.</p><p>This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \"Scale\" really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you\u2019ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you\u2019ll need to do so.</p><p>The techniques you\u2019ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you\u2019ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you\u2019ll use include Cilk Plus, OpenMP, and MPI, and possibly others.)</p>",
    "syllabus": "<p>The course topics are centered on three different ideas or extensions to the usual serial RAM model you encounter in CS 101. Recall that a serial RAM assumes a sequential or serial processor connected to a main memory.</p><ul><li>Unit 1: The work-span or dynamic multithreading model</li></ul><p>In this model, the idea is that there are multiple processors connected to the main memory. Since they can all \"see\" the same memory, the processors can coordinate and communicate via reads and writes to that \"shared\" memory.</p><p>Sub-topics include:</p><p>** Intro to the basic algorithmic model<br>** Intro to OpenMP, a practical programming model<br>** Comparison-based sorting algorithms<br>** Scans and linked list algorithms<br>** Tree algorithms<br>** Graph algorithms, e.g., breadth-first search</p><ul><li>Unit 2: Distributed memory or network models</li></ul><p>In this model, the idea is that there is not one serial RAM, but many serial RAMs connected by a network.

Instead, the taxicabs are operated by self-driving agents \u2014 known as <strong>smartcabs</strong> \u2014 to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate. In major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco, an increasing number of people have come to rely on <strong>smartcabs</strong> to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible. Although <strong>smartcabs</strong> have become the transport of choice, concerns have arose that a self-driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human drivers, particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles. To alleviate these concerns, your task as an employee for a national taxicab company is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a <strong>smartcab</strong> operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved.</p>",

You\u2019ll understand what \"semantics\" and \"semantic markup\" mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally, you\u2019ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.</p><p>This course is also featured in our <a href=\"/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004\">Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree</a> program.</p>",
    "syllabus": "<h2>Lesson 1: Overview</h2><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll learn why accessibility matters, and who it affects. You\u2019ll also get a first look at the web accessibility guidelines (WAI \u2013 Web Accessibility Initiative), understand what \"POUR\" means for accessibility, and locate checklists to help make your own sites accessible.</p><h2>Lesson 2: Focus</h2><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to make a page usable for anyone navigating with the keyboard. This starts with an introduction to the concept of focus (the element on the page to which keyboard events will be targeted), how to make elements focusable and when, and the order in which focusable elements will be traversed when exploring the page with the keyboard. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. </p><h2>Lesson 3: Semantics Basics</h2><p>In this lesson you\u2019ll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can&#39;t see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. You\u2019ll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. You\u2019ll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. </p><h2>Lesson 4: Semantics Extras</h2><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. You\u2019ll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! You\u2019ll also learn how to call out \"landmarks\" into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this \"semantic markup\"  also makes your markup more readable!)</p><h2>Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIA</h2><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and that\u2019s where ARIA comes in \u2013 Accessible Rich Internet Applications. You\u2019ll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.</p><h2>Lesson 6: Style</h2><p>In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your page\u2019s styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. You\u2019ll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.</p>",

You\u2019ll learn the importance of separating concerns when writing JavaScript, gaining hands-on experience along the way. Separating concerns can be done with or without an organizational library or framework. We\u2019ll learn how to separate concerns without one, and then we\u2019ll explore an organizational library together. You\u2019ll also learn strategies for exploring other libraries and frameworks on your own.</p><p>By the end of this course, you\u2019ll understand (from experience) the importance of code organization, and how to implement it with either vanilla JavaScript or an organizational library or framework. Your applications will start looking clean and professional\u2014not just to your users, but also to anyone who looks at the code driving your applications.</p>",
    "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1: Changing Expectations</h3><p>We&#39;ll first start by building a project the way you already know how: without an overarching organizational paradigm. Specifically, we&#39;ll discuss pain points and difficulties that are easy to run into when you don&#39;t use an organizational model. Then, we&#39;ll discuss a paradigm that will help us in the future, and we\u2019ll see some examples of that paradigm in action.</p><h3>Lesson 2: Refactoring</h3><p>We&#39;ll spend some time discussing how our new paradigm applies to the project we worked on in Lesson 1. Then we&#39;ll rebuild the project with the new organizational paradigm.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Using an Organizational Library</h3><p>We&#39;ll explore how to use KnockoutJS, an organizational library, to organize our code and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code we write. Our resulting application will be well-organized, easy to understand, and extendable.</p><h3>Lesson 4: Exploring Unfamiliar Code</h3><p>In this final lesson, we&#39;ll spend some time talking about how to explore code that you didn&#39;t write, possibly even using a library or framework that you aren&#39;t familiar with. Exploration is one of the most important skills for a developer to foster. and this lesson will get you started on that journey.</p>",
