It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

This course is designed to teach web developers what they need to know to create great cross-device mobile web experiences. This course will focus on building mobile web apps, which will work across multiple platforms including Android, iOS, and others.</p>",
    "syllabus": "<p>In this course, you will learn how to build web experiences that adapt to the different screen sizes and capabilities that mobile devices offer, and how to scalably optimize media for mobile and desktop.  We will cover programming touch interaction, as well as how to optimize form field input for mobile devices and use APIs like geolocation and the accelerometer, and ensuring your web experiences work great when network conditions are sub-optimal.  Finally, you\u2019ll gain the tools to investigate performance in mobile applications, with a strong understanding of mobile networking, battery usage patterns and optimizing paint techniques to build smooth animations on mobile.</p><h3>Lesson 01: Syllabus</h3><p>We\u2019ll start with a high-level overview of the course and what to expect in it. We\u2019ll also go into more depth on what we mean by mobile web development, and why you should care about it.</p><h3>Lesson 02: Mobile Development Tools</h3><p>Workflow and tooling is incredibly important for building great web apps, and this carries over to mobile web development. This lesson will show you how to use the Chrome Developer Tools to develop for the mobile web.</p><h3>Lesson 03: Mobile UX and Viewport</h3><p>Designing for the mobile web is all about a smooth user experience. This lesson will get you thinking about how to achieve that on mobile, and we\u2019ll introduce the first of many tools you need to achieve this: the viewport.</p><h3>Lesson 04: Fluid Design</h3><p>Mobile means lots of different devices and form factors. We\u2019ll discuss how to make your site responsive, clean, and user-friendly on multiple devices and layouts.</p><h3>Lesson 05: Media Queries</h3><p>Sometimes different devices call for fundamentally different layouts. This lesson will teach you how to achieve this using media queries.</p><h3>Lesson 06: Responsive Images</h3><p>Media requirements are different in mobile - network constraints and very high resolution screens set up a conflict that can be challenging.  We\u2019ll talk about how best to integrate media into your mobile web applications, and adaptively scaling images based on the environment.</p><h3>Lesson 07: Optimizing Performance</h3><p>Users expect a fast, seamless experience on mobile. We\u2019ll go over optimizing various performance metrics to improve that experience, such as network, cpu, rendering, and battery performance.</p><h3>Lesson 08: Touch</h3><p>Touch input is fundamentally different from mouse input, and requires you to think about your user interactions differently. We\u2019ll go over UX concerns with touch-based interaction, and how to design user interactions that work across devices.</p><h3>Lesson 09: Input</h3><p>Using a keyboard on mobile is awful. We\u2019ll discuss ways to improve it, using semantic input for form data, and other user input options on mobile.</p><h3>Lesson 10: Device Access</h3><p>Mobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop. We\u2019ll talk about camera access, geolocation, and other sensors and feedback you have access to on mobile.</p><h3>Lesson 11: Offline and Storage</h3><p>It\u2019s an unfortunate reality that mobile users aren\u2019t always online. We\u2019ll go over using the local cache as well as local storage APIs to give your users a great offline (and partially-online) experience as well.</p><h3>Lesson 12: Wrap-up</h3><p>We\u2019ll finish up the class by talking briefly about other topics to consider, such as app experience, monetization, deployment and distribution. We\u2019ll also point you to other resources to look at moving forward in your career.</p>",

It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace.

This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### How much does this cost? It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

    "faq": "### When does the course begin? This class is self paced. You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\u2019s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.### How long will the course be available? This class will always be available! ### How do I know if this course is for me? Take a look at the \"Class Summary,\" \"What Should I Know,\" and \"What Will I Learn\" sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons? Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.### What are the rules on collaboration? Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. ### Why are there so many questions? Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos? Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

Many startups fail by not validating their ideas early on with real-life customers. In order to mitigate that, students will learn how to get out of the building and search for the real pain points and unmet needs of customers. Only with these can the entrepreneur find a proper solution and establish a suitable business model.</p><p>Building a startup is not simply building an execution plan for a business model that the entrepreneur thinks will work, but rather, a search for the actual business model itself.</p>",

You will also learn to use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) as an alternative to SQL.<br><h3>Lesson 2 - Making a Web Server</h3><br><p>In the second lesson, you will build a web server from scratch using Python and some of the pre-installed libraries it includes. You will learn what GET and POST requests are and how we use them to retrieve and modify information on a web site. We will then use the concepts learned in Lesson 1 to add CRUD functionality to our website.<br><h3>Lesson 3 - Developing with Frameworks</h3><br>In the third lesson, we will discuss web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails. You will see how web frameworks simplify the development process and allow us to create web applications faster. We will use the Flask web framework to develop our own web application. We will also discuss API&#39;s (Application Programming Interfaces) and add JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) endpoints to our application to allow data to be sent in a format alternative to HTML. <br><h3>Lesson 4 - Iterative Development</h3><br>In the last lesson, you will build an entire web application on your own. You will learn about the iterative development process and how developing iteratively allows you to have a working prototype throughout all stages of the development process.</p>",

    "syllabus": "<p>You\u2019ll learn how to start with a question and/or a dataset, and use machine learning to turn them into insights. </p><h3>Lessons 1-4: Supervised Classification</h3><p><strong>Naive Bayes:</strong> We jump in headfirst, learning perhaps the world\u2019s greatest algorithm for classifying text.</p><p><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs):</strong> One of the top 10 algorithms in machine learning, and a must-try for many classification tasks.  What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.</p><p><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.</p><h3>Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions</h3><p>Behind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.</p><h3>Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers</h3><p>Regressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  What\u2019s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  We\u2019ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.</p><h3>Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning</h3><p><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> The flagship algorithm when you don\u2019t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.</p><h3>Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features</h3><p><strong>Feature Creation:</strong> Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.</p><p><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.</p><p><strong>Principal Component Analysis:</strong> A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.</p><p><strong>Feature Scaling:</strong> Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.<br>Learning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.</p><h3>Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation</h3><p><strong>Training/testing data split:</strong> How do you know that what you\u2019re doing is working?  You don\u2019t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.</p><p><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> Take the training/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.</p><p><strong>Precision, recall, and F1 score:</strong>  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.</p><h3>Lesson 15: Wrapping it all Up</h3><p>We take a step back and review what we\u2019ve learned, and how it all fits together.  </p><h3>Projects</h3><p>Mini-project at the end of each lesson</p><p><strong>Final project:</strong> searching for signs of corporate fraud in Enron data</p>",

Designing good A/B tests and drawing valid conclusions can be difficult. You can almost never measure exactly what you want to know (such as whether the users are &quot;happier&quot; on one version of the site), so you need to find good proxies. You need sanity checks to make sure your experimental set-up isn&#39;t flawed, and you need to use a variety of statistical techniques to make sure the results you&#39;re seeing aren&#39;t due to chance. This course will walk you through the entire process. At the end, you will be ready to help businesses small or large make crucial decisions that could significantly affect their future!</p>",

    "summary": "<p>This course will cover the design and analysis of A/B tests, also known as split tests, which are online experiments used to test potential improvements to a website or mobile application. Two versions of the website are shown to different users - usually the existing website and a potential change. Then, the results are analyzed to determine whether the change is an improvement worth launching. This course will cover how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power, how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions, and how to ensure that the the participants of your experiments are adequately protected.</p>",
    "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1: Overview of A/B Testing</h3><p>This lesson will cover what A/B testing is and what it can be used for. It will also cover an example A/B test from start to finish, including how to decide how long to run the experiment, how to construct a binomial confidence interval for the results, and how to decide whether the change is worth the launch cost.</p><h3>Lesson 2: Policy and Ethics for Experiments</h3><p>This lesson will cover how to make sure the participants of your experiments are adequately protected and what questions you should be asking regarding the ethicality of experiments. It will cover four main ethics principles to consider when designing experiments: the risk to the user, the potential benefits, what alternatives users have to participating in the experiment, and the sensitivity of the data being collected.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Choosing and Characterizing Metrics</h3><p>One of the most important and time-consuming pieces of designing an A/B test is choosing and validating metrics to use in evaluating your experiment. This lesson will cover techniques for brainstorming metrics, what to do when you can&#39;t measure what you want directly, and characteristics you should consider when validating your metrics.</p><h3>Lesson 4: Designing an Experiment</h3><p>This lesson will cover how to design an A/B test. This includes how to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group - different online definitions of a &quot;user&quot;, and what effects different choices will have on your experiment. It will also cover when to  limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base, how to calculate how many events you will need in order to draw strong conclusions from your results, and how this translates into how long to run the experiment. Finally, the lesson will cover how various design decisions affect the size of your experiment, so you will know which decisions to revisit if you need results more quickly.</p><h3>Lesson 5: Analyzing Results</h3><p>This lesson will cover how to analyze the results of your experiments. Step one is always to run some sanity checks so that you can catch problems with your experiment set-up. Then, you will learn how to check conclusions with multiple methods, including a hypothesis test on the effect size and a binomial sign test, if you get results that surprise you. You will also learn how measuring multiple metrics for the same experiment can make analysis difficult, and some techniques for handling multiple metrics. Finally, you will learn about several analysis &quot;gotchas&quot;, and what to do if you see them, including how Simpson&#39;s Paradox can affect A/B tests, and why even statistically significant results might disappear when you launch.</p><h3>Final Project: Design and Analyze an A/B Test</h3><p>Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.</p>",

You could implement web security and permissions on your own, but relying on trusted providers is a faster, safer, and easier way to allow users to login to your application - without having to create and maintain another account, profile, and password. </p><p>In this course, you will learn to implement the OAuth 2.0 framework to allow users to securely login to your web applications. You&#39;ll be provided a  <a href=\"http://udacity-oauth.herokuapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant menu application</a> created in Flask. By the end of this course, you will write the necessary code to implement Google+ Sign-In and Facebook Login in options so users can create restaurant menus that are viewable by everyone but only modifiable by the original creator.</p>",
    "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1 - Authentication vs. Authorization</h3><p>Learn the difference between the concepts of authentication and authorization and address some major security concerns that developers must protect against when developing a web application.  You will learn how OAuth 2.0 makes implementing security easier for developers and users alike by allowing your users to sign in to your applications while keeping all of the security on well-known and trusted OAuth providers. Finally, you will see OAuth 2.0 in action as you make API requests using Google&#39;s OAuth 2.0 Playground.</p><h3>Lesson 2 - Creating a Google+ Sign-In</h3><p>Learn about the different types of security flows your application can implement. You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user&#39;s browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow.</p><h3>Lesson 3 - Local Permission Systems</h3><p>Add python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider&#39;s API.</p><h3>Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook &amp; Other Providers</h3><p>Learn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application. You will add Facebook Login as an alternative sign in option for your users and understand how to use OAuth provider documentation to add as many providers as you see fit for your application.</p>",

Dive into basic Storm Topologies by linking to a real-time d3 Word Cloud Visualization using Redis, Flask, and d3. </p><h3>Lesson 2</h3><p>Explore Storm basics by programming Bolts, linking Spouts, and finally connecting to the live Twitter API to process real-time tweets.  Explore open source components by connecting a Rolling Count Bolt to your topology to visualize Rolling Top Tweeted Words.</p><h3>Lesson 3</h3><p>Go beyond Storm basics by exploring multi-language capabilities to download and parse real-time Tweeted URLs in Python using Beautiful Soup.  Integrate complex open source bolts to calculate Top-N words to visualize real-time Top-N Hashtags.  Finally, use stream grouping concepts to easily create streaming join to connect and dynamically process multiple streams.</p><h3>Lesson 4</h3><p>Work on your final project and we cover additional questions and topics brought up by Hackathon participants.  Explore Vagrant, VirtualBox, Redis, Flask, and d3 further if you are interested!</p><h3>Final Project: Construct a Storm Topology</h3><p>Design a Storm Topology and new bolt that uses streaming joins to dynamically calculate Top-N Hashtags and display real-time tweets that contain trending Top Hashtags.

As smart phone like devices enable ubiquitous access to web and voice channels, the convergence of telephony with the Internet gives rise to new cross-channel threats that can combine online and voice attacks. For example, voice phishing with caller-id spoofing has been reported for stealing online banking credentials. His data-driven research approach for exploring cross-channel threats has resulted in better understanding of these threats and more effective ways to combat them.

The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.</p><p>So why should you learn d3.js?</p><p>Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.</p><p>If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a <code>for</code> loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript.

    "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1a Visualization Fundamentals (2 hours)</h3><p>Learn about the elements of great data visualization. In this lesson, you will meet data visualization experts, learn about data visualization in the context of data science, and learn how to represent data values in visual form.</p><h3>Lesson 1b D3 Building Blocks (4 hours)</h3><p>Learn how to use the open standards of the web to create graphical elements. You\u2019ll learn how to select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements. Make use of all the Instructor Notes throughout this lesson if you have little to no experience with HTML and CSS.</p><h3>Mini-Project 1: RAW Visualization (2 hours)</h3><p>Create a data visualization using a software of your choice. We will provide recommendations for visualization software as well as data sets. We want you to get right into making data visualization so here\u2019s your first chance!</p><h3>Lesson 2a Design Principles (2 hours)</h3><p>Which chart type should I use for my data? Which colors should I avoid when making graphics? How do I know if my graphic is effective? Investigate these questions, and learn about the World Cup data set which will be use throughout the rest of the course.</p><h3>Lesson 2b Dimple.js (4 hours)</h3><p>Learn how to create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library. You will learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about D3.js. You will be able to produce great graphics with minimal code, and all of your graphics will come with interactivity without any extra effort on your part. Dimple, it&#39;s simple!</p><h3>Mini-Project 2: Take Two (2-5 hours)</h3><p>Find an existing data visualization, critique it for what it does well and what it doesn\u2019t do well, and finally, recreate the graphic using a software tool of your choice. We recommend using Dimple.js, which is covered in Lesson 2b, but we don\u2019t want you to feel constrained by the choice of tools. Use any tool that works for you.</p><h3>Special Note</h3><p>At this point in the course, you can start the final project. The remaining content of the course covers narrative structures, types of bias, and maps. All of the code  in Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 pertains to d3.js. If you&#39;d like to learn d3.js and complete the final project using d3.js, then please continue. If you prefer to stop, you can complete the final project using dimple.js.</p><h3>Lesson 3 Narratives (5 hours)</h3><p>Learn how to incorporate different narrative structures into your visualizations and code along with Jonathan as you create a graphic for the World Cup data set. You\u2019ll learn about different types of bias in the data visualization process and learn how to add context to your data visualizations. By the end of this lesson, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation in D3.js.</p><h3>Lesson 4 Animation and Interaction (5 hours)</h3><p>Static graphics are great, but interactive graphics can be even better. Learn how to leverage animation and interaction to bring more data insights to your audience. Code along with Jonathan once again as you learn how to create a bubble map for the World Cup data set.</p><h3>Final Project: Making an Effective Data Visualization (2 hours or more)</h3><p>You will create a data visualization that conveys a clear message about a data set. You will use dimple.js or d3.js and collect feedback along the way to arrive at a polished product.</p><h4><b>NOTE:</b> As a free student, you are welcome to complete the project to showcase your learning; however, only students enrolled in the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002\" target=\"_blank\">Data Analyst Nanodegree</a> are able to submit the final project for review and certificate.

This lesson will help you develop, validate and refine your ideas to ensure you\u2019re building for a product/market fit. Through case studies and interviews with founders, product experts, and investors, you will learn how to efficiently conduct user research and build an entrepreneurial mindset.</p><h3>Lesson 2: UI/UX</h3><p>They say good design shrinks the gap between what a product does and why it exists. This lesson takes you beyond visual style to understand material design, building for accessibility, user flows and personas. You\u2019ll hear about how startups make design decisions and learn from senior designers at Google on how they use design to emphasize the purpose of their products.<br>By the end of the lesson, you will analyze the user experience of another product and start documenting a user flow for your own product.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Design Sprint</h3><p>Created by Google Ventures, the Design Sprint Process is widely used by teams seeking to design, prototype, and test their ideas with customers. In this lesson, Google\u2019s leading Design Sprint Master will help you go through all the steps required to validate your ideas and build mockups of your product. You will also get a first-hand look at how design sprints happen at Udacity and how you can design &amp; conduct your own. </p><h3>Lesson 4: Key Metrics</h3><p>In the final lesson, you will learn to identify common metrics for websites and apps relating to traffic, customer satisfaction, and engagement. You will learn tools that can be used to monitor metrics and examples from startups on what metrics not to measure. </p><p>At the end of the lesson, you will identify actionable metrics that will work best for your own product.</p>",

    "faq": "Before course development started, we asked you what questions you had about Apple's Swift language. Here are the answers to your most burning questions:\r\r### Why is the language called Swift?\rThe language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. \r\r### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?\rSwift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you won\u2019t miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.\r\r### How easy is Swift to learn?\rSwift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/\">According to Apple</a>, Swift is the \"first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.\" Some have even <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186/\" target=\"_blank\">called Swift the new BASIC</a>.\r\r### Is it fast?\r<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple boasts</a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.\r\r### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?\rObjective-C has been Apple\u2019s primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.\r\r### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?\rAbsolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.\r\r### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?\rAs mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show it\u2019s age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.\r\r### How Stable is Swift?\rAs with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.\r\rThe thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17\" target=\"_blank\">failable initializers</a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655\" target=\"_blank\">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*</a>.\r\r### What other languages is it similar to?\rSwift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though you\u2019ll also probably recognize some C syntax. \r\r### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?\rSwift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.",

    "syllabus": "<h3>Lesson 1: What is EDA? (1 hour)</h3><p>We&#39;ll start by learn about what exploratory data analysis (EDA) is and why it is important. You&#39;ll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project.</p><h3>Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours)</h3><p>EDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets.</p><h3>Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours)</h3><p>We perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations.</p><h3>Problem Set 3 (2 hours)</h3><h3>Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours)</h3><p>EDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We&#39;ll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means.</p><h3>Problem Set 4 (2 hours)</h3><h3>Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours)</h3><p>Data sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We&#39;ll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we&#39;ll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well.</p><h3>Problem Set 5 (2 hours)</h3><h3>Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours)</h3><p>Investigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He&#39;ll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project, you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice.</p><h3>Final Project (10+ hours)</h3><p>You&#39;ve explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set. Now, it&#39;s your turn to conduct your own exploratory data analysis. Choose one data set to explore (one provided by Udacity or your own) and create a RMD file that uncovers the patterns, anomalies and relationships of the data set.</p>",

We\u2019ll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition.  We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really classification theory best learned in an ML course.</p><p>The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the problem sets. All algorithms work perfectly in the slides. But remember what <a href=\"http://yogiberramuseum.org/just-for-fun/yogisms/\">Yogi Berra</a> said: In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. (Einstein said something similar but who knows more about real life?) In this course you do not, for the most part, apply high-level library functions but use low to mid level algorithms to analyze images and extract structural information.</p>",

In this lesson, we\u2019ll cover the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport.  You\u2019ll start the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.  </p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>Why start small and build up?</li><li>What is the viewport?</li><li>Sizing the content to the viewport<ul><li>avoiding static sized items</li></ul></li><li>Touch targets, and why they should be large</li></ul><h3>Lesson 3 - Building Up</h3><p>Once you\u2019ve got a page optimized for small screens, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how they\u2019ll look on larger screens.  Learn how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.</p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>CSS media queries</li><li>What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one</li><li>Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout</li></ul><h3>Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns</h3><p>Now that you\u2019ve got the basics of responsive design down, you\u2019ll learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. You&#39;ll also iterate on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.</p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>Mostly fluid pattern</li><li>Column drop pattern</li><li>Layout shifter pattern</li><li>Off canvas pattern</li></ul><h3>Lesson 5 - Optimizations</h3><p>Learn strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. You\u2019ll also learn about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, you&#39;ll iterate for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.</p><p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p><ul><li>Minor break points</li><li>Optimizing text layout<ul><li>font size</li><li>optimal line length</li></ul></li><li>Responsive tables, and strategies for dealing with them</li></ul>",
